Hello, I’m **Weitung**! CEO, Lead Engineer of Nexuni Co. I received my bachelor’s degree in EECS at MIT. I love doing hands-on works that can bring my ideas to solve real-world challenges. While in my second year at MIT I teamed up with some friends and started a company called [**Nexuni, Co.**](https://www.nexuni.com), which is developing automation technologies, including AI, robotics, IoT, to help clients increase the efficiency of labor-intensive works in their businesses.
<br><br>
My years at MIT have helped me lay rigorous theoretical foundations in the fields of **AI, embedded systems, and robotics**. Starting a company with intense R&D works has provided me with tremendous experience in the techniques of rapid prototyping and then integrating these quick creations into the development of various technologies for evaluation. I will continue to use my knowledge and experience to work on things that impact the world.
