# Life at MIT Series

The following is created for the final project of MIT MAS 110, Fundamentals of Computational Media Design. 

Humans have mastered the skill to create art through different means and styles. As technology advances, new forms of art emerge, for example, photography, video art, and algorithmic art. As Artificial Intelligence has been a popular topic in recent years, I’ve always been interested in knowing how computers perform on creating art. For my final project, I applied the neural algorithm I used in essay 3 and experimented with more different styles. Overall, I generated around 80 images with 20 different stylistic images. In these 80 images, I picked six images, shown in Figure 1, to form a series – Life at MIT, depicting the change in my feelings throughout this semester. I created the first image in the series by feeding the neural network model a cave painting. After three months of summer break and interning oversea, I came back to MIT as a sophomore and everything seemed familiar to me, but I also feel that my freshman life was getting further from me. This ancient style drawing of MIT seems to represent my feeling at the time. The second image was created in the art style similar to that adopted in The Docks of the Port of Bastia by Herbin, Auguste. This picture gave me a feeling of joy which is similar to my feelings at the beginning of the semester. I caught up with old friends and meet new friends in several events, having a great time without any coursework. Afterward, I started to have a lot of psets, UROP works, club activities, and they were just like the blocks stacking up, occupying my life. Then, the midterms struck me like lightning, which gave me a similar feeling in the fourth image, created by merging the style of Pumpkins by Yayoi, Kusama. The exams all happened at around the same time, giving me lots of pressure then. Finally, it is almost the end of the semester. I started to prepare for the quizzes and finalized the psets and final projects of three of my classes. One of the psets took me a considerable amount of time and just as I mentioned in essay 3, there was an evening where I felt desperate because I was sick and haven’t finished the psets that came due the following day, and the fifth image gave me a similar feeling which represents that evening. Despite the amount of workload, I managed to get through this semester and learned a lot from the classes. The final image in the series gave me a feeling of growing knowledge with a significant amount of fruits of knowledge in the picture. After experimenting with all different kinds of art styles, I realized that it is interesting how different art styles arouse different feelings.
